# Progressive Budget

## Description

My motivation for the assignment was to be able to apply backend concepts into understanding how I can have data/information/input stored locally AND offline.
I built this project so then I could have access to using a deployed site OFFLINE, then the storage that is saved offline, will automatically be added once I can get back online.
The progressive budget solves tracking my transactions in real-time, not having to worry whether I am online or offline.
I learned that I can store data offline then have it pending, then be retrieved once back online.

## Usage

By typing in the name of your transaction, then the amount (INT), choosing ADD funds will positively increase your budget, choosing SUBTRACT funds will negatively decrease your budget!

Even if offline, you may still use the deployed website! Once you are back online, your pending transactions will automatically update into your budget!
